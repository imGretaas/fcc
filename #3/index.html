	<h1>Who I am</h1>
	<p>Hi, I&#39;m Francesco Pistore and I&#39;m a student of the MSc Finance in Venice, Italy. Of course this has nothing to do with my online jobs.. well! Here I have some space to explain what happened in the last years that brought me here. If you have questions feel free to send me a message via the contact form! :)</p>
	<p>I am interested in many things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Photography and Travel</li>
		<li>SEO</li>
		<li>Web</li>
		<li>Finance</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My passion of photography started at age 14, in 2006, when I received my first pocket camera. I started to make some photos but I noticed, some years later, that I was doing more vlogs than photos and that was strange during first 2000s.<br>
	Some years later I stole my mum&#39;s D90 and I made her go around Europe to shoot amazing pictures.</p>
	<p>During 2009, when I was 17, I founded my first website that was called &#8220;<em>pistonet</em>&#8221;. Some years later, in 2012, I discovered WordPress with its plugin, themes and, most of all, the SEO.<br>
	Since that discovery a world has opened up to me and I started with another big and great adventure: &#8220;<a href="https://stintup.com">Stintup</a>&#8221;.<br>
	Stintup is a magazine and my job during my university years. Thanks to Stintup I traveled a lot, I visited more than 25 countries, and I achieved press membership to important events like MWC in Barcelona, Geneva International Motor Show, AME Padua and EXPO 2015 in Milan.</p>
	<p>Last but not least, I attended the University of Ca&#39; Foscari in Venice, Italy. I did my Bachelor's degree in Economics and Management and, after that, I took a MSc in Finance.<br>
	I have a big passion for financial markets since 2013, year when I started training and investing. Some years later I discovered the magical world of FinTech, where my two passions merge together; IT and Finance.<br>
	During 2017 I started to study cryptocurrencies and the technology behind it (blockchain), some months later I started investing on it.
