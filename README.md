IT, 30th July 2020

I'm attending the Responsive Web Design's course offered by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp</a>.

I completed many exercises about these different arguments: 
- basic of HTML and HTML5, 
- CSS,
- Visual Design,
- Accessibility,
- Responsive Web Design,
- CSS Flexbox,
- CSS Grid.

I still have to do 5 projects with different characteristics:
- Build a tribute page,
- Build a survey form,
- Build a Product Landing Page,
- Build a Technical Documentation Page,
- Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.

I'll use GitHub to upload my 5 projects. yo.
