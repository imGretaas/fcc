		Disco Music is a genre of dance music and subculture that emerged in the 70s from the States' urban nightlife scene. <br>
		Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, horns, electric piano, synth and elecrtic rhythm guitars.
	</p>
	<p>
		The genre was made popular worldwide by artists like: Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Earth Wind & Fire, Bee Gees, Chic, Diana Ross, KC and The Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Sister Sledge, The Trammps, Village People and Michael Jackson. <br>
		Films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Thank God It's Friday (1978) contribuited to disco's mainstream popularity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular with African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Italian Americans and LGBT people in Philadelphia and NYC during the late 60s and early 70s. <br>
		That genre can be seen as a reaction by the 60s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the late 70s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54, disco club par excellence on the disco music genre and popular venue among celebrities, in NYC. <br>
		There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and around the mirror ball. <br>
		Finally, Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of that era.
	</p>
	<p>
		The genre was the last popular music movement driven by baby boomers, peaking in popularity during the mid-late 70s. It declined as a major trend in popular music during the late 70s and early 80s, but remained a key influence in the development of electronic dance music, house music, hip-hop, new wave and post-disco.<br>
		While no new disco movement has dominated popular music since its decline, the style has had several revivals since the 90s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music.
