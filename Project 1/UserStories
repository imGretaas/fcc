Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. 

User Stories:

#1 x	My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
#2 x	I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
#3 x	I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
#4 x	Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
#5 x	Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
#6 x	I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
#7 x	I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
#8 x	The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
#9 x	The img element should be centered within its parent element.
